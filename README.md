Module 12 Challenge

Here are my files for the Module 12 Challenge!

The 'setup_starter' covers the first part of the assignment and 'analysis_starter' covers the rest. They both pull from the JSON file in the 'Resources' folder to work their magic.

The 'Checkpoint' file just has the original starter code in case we need it someday. 

Cheers!
